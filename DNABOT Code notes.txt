CLIP_FNAME_1 etc - Assign final filenames - names of the output files

Series of constants - not sure what all of these do e.g. CLIP_DEAD_VOL??

Spotting dicts for omni-tray (96-well) and 12-well plates
	deprecate the 96-well?

Source_deck_positions - not sure what these are used for

def__cli() - Command line interface, defines all parameters if not using GUI
